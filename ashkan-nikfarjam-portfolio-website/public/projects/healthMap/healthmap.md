# HealthMap: Intractive DataAnalysis Dashboard
Conducted an in-depth analysis of a government-provided dataset focusing on three common respiratory diseases in the United States: COVID-19, Influenza, and Pneumonia, utilizing Python libraries for data processing and visualization.

Developed an interactive map of the United States by generating state polygons using geoJSON coordinates. Enhanced the visualization with a color-coded scheme representing yearly and total deaths per capita across the country.

Provided comprehensive monthly analysis of death rates for each state, presenting the findings through a combination of monthly line plots and accompanying tables.

Explored the correlation between death rates and age using a heatmap alongside a corresponding summary table.
